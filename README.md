# Card Game 
It has UNO like logic. There is one Open card and each player gets 5 cards. Player can discard a card when the symbol or the value of the card matched. If there is no matching card the player has to draw a card from the card pile. If the player disacrd all his cards, he wins. If the draw deck pile is empty then the game ends in a draw. Four players can play this game. 

## Technical Description 
I have built the Front End using React Js. The backend is built using Express JS. MongoDB is used as Database. I also used sockets for communication.
I have used terminal logs. So that the reviewer can look at the Data structure.
